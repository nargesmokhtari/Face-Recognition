In cybersecurity, the term image spoofing refers to an advanced form of visual forgery attack used to deceive identity recognition systems. In these attacks, attackers use 2D images or videos (such as printed photos or images displayed on a screen) or even 3D masks and models to try to fool biometric systems, such as facial recognition, allowing unauthorized access to devices or information.
To combat this threat, advanced technologies are being used. The most important of these is a set called liveness detection; a system that analyzes natural facial movements such as blinking, smiling, or subtle skin changes (detecting color texture and depth) to try to determine whether the image actually belongs to a living person. Both active detection methods (asking the user to move) and passive detection (automatic image analysis without user intervention) are used. Also, deep feature analysis using convolutional neural networks such as MobileNetV2 or Vision Transformer has shown that diagnoses can be made with an accuracy of over 90%.
